Generate include files
======================

* Click on "Bearbeiten" -> "CCode generieren"
* The include files will be generated in the folder you have specified in "Projekteinstellungen" or if not so,
  in the program root folder, and will be named

  * microRay.h
  * microRay.cpp

* Recompile and upload your code to the controller.
* Dependent on the interface you are using, reestablish communication with the controller by hitting
  the play button in the upper left area.
