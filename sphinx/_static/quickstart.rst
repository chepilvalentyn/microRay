Quickstart
==========

The basic steps to use microRay are as follows:

* Create a project in microRay and add channels and parameters you want to watch and control.
* Generate the include files, that you must include in your controller code.
* Use the previously defined channels and parameters in your controller code.
* Compile and upload the code.
* Now watch the channel values changing and adapt parameter values on the controller.

All steps are explained in the following chapters in more detail.
